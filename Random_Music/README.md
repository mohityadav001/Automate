While working, many devs love listening to music. So for music lovers (like me), this script randomly picks a song from a folder containing songs and plays it with the help of the OS and random modules in Python.

The code goes to the music directory containing all the songs you want to play, and puts them all in a list. Then it randomly plays each song one after the other. The os.startfile plays the song.

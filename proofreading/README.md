The first on the list is proofreading. Whenever you want to eliminate grammar and spelling mistakes from your writing, you can try this project that uses the Lmproof module.
First, you'll need to install the lmproof library for this automation. Then you can use the function proofread() which takes in text as a parameter. The function runs and prints the original text that was passed into the function as well as the corrected text. You can use it to quickly proofread an essay or a short article.
